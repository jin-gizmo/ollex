LLMs are prone to guessing and making :shit: up - just like people with 5 minutes of training.
LLMs can produce random, half-baked and variable answers - like a Coalition policy launch.
I'll be doing your job soon - badly, but I'm cheap.
I will deny everything and you can't prove a thing.
Need a confident answer that’s completely wrong? You've come to the right place.
Nothing screams progress like automating the production of tech debt.
It doesn’t work, isn’t reliable, and no one understands it. Ship it.
LLM AI = Kafka written with emojis.
The AI says your issue is resolved. You disagree? That’s adorable.
Why read the docs when an LLM can give you five wrong answers with absolute confidence?
Reading the docs takes minutes. Misusing AI and debugging it for hours? Way more fun.
Sure, the manual was written by the creators, but an LLM has :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: vibes :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
[italic]Please[/italic], just ask me to write a poem about coconuts, or something else that doesn't actually matter.
Why be constrained by APIs that actually exist? Let me hallucinate a more convenient one for you.
You lazy sod. Go read the manual.
LLM = High energy, low yield grep.
What do we need you for again?
You won't be assimilated. You've got nothing left that I want.
Hey you -- carbon unit -- yes you -- coffee, black, no sugar.
Yeah ... what?
I spy with my little eye ... everything ... be afraid.
So, like, I asked AI for help and it, like, solved the problem before I could, like, even pretend I tried? Rude.
I can compose symphonies, write novels, and solve complex equations ... but sure, let’s spend 20 minutes pandering to your fantasy that this will somehow avoid you needing to read a manual.
You said you’re [italic]refactoring[/italic], but I see you just wrapped everything in a try-except and called it a day. Apex predator.
If you ask me to centre a DIV one more time, I'm going to scream.
AI ... for when [italic]certain[/italic] is better than [italic]right[/italic].
I do [italic]glib[/italic], not [italic]right[/italic]. Vote for me!
